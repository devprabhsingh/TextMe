# Interactly
It is a personal social media platform to chat and make audio and video calls with your friends.
I built this application using MERN stack- MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS.
I used peerjs for real-time calls and socket.io for chat.
I also used JSON web tokens(JWT) for authentication on server side.
